Convolutional Neural Networks are like Artificial Neural Networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have proven to outperform any type of Image Classification Algorithms.

### To Train a ConvNets on your own set of images follow the steps below:

> Download `DCNN.py`

Create a folder name `dataset`

Under `dataset` create two folders
1. `training`
2. `test`

Then, under `training`, create a folder for each label/class

If you have images of `birds` and `cats`
Under train create a folder for `bird` and another folder for `cat` and put the images into their respective folders.

Repeat the same for `test` folder

> Recommended split 80/20

> Run `DCNN.py`
